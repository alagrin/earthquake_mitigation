## AI For Earthquake Mitigation

Project Description: A major earthquake has the potential of severely damaging Seattleâ€™s transportation network and logistical supply chains. Existing supply chains (wherever people typically get their food/water/supplies) are the most efficient means of getting supplies to the entire population of the City, so the City will work to support and reestablish those as quickly as possible. However, this may take time and there may be a period where the City needs to set up Community Points of Distribution (CPOD) to distribute food, water, and emergency commodities to the public. The City has selected some initial CPOD sites, but would like to conduct further analysis to identify potential equity issues. Areas that we would like to look at include:

Walkability: Which neighborhoods are within easy walking distance (accounting for steep slopes, bridges that might be damaged/impassable, are there sidewalks) of preliminary sites; which neighborhoods would be underserved?
How accessible are the sites by transit (focusing on Metros Emergency Snow Network, since transit service will likely be severely reduced), are they accessible for people with mobility challenges or who use wheelchairs?
Potential overlap with commercial distributors (vs establishment in grocery deserts/neighborhoods without commercial options).
